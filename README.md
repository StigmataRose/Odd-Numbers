# Odd Numbers

This project quickly evolved into running timing tests for creating a list of odd numbers and reversed list of odd numbers.

## Base
This function utilizes logic to find the odd numbers in a loop from 0 to max, then macros the reversed list

## 2X Iter
This function uses a range the increments by 2 starting at 1, while using logic to create the reverse list

## Hardcoded
This function hardcodes the tuple's and is timed while copying the tuples to their corresponding lists.

## Summary
The results are to be expected for basic optimization. This project served as proof of concept and practice for testing python functions.
